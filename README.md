PREDICTION OF MATERIAL THICKNESS USING RANDOM FOREST AND LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 WE NEED TO PREDICT THE MATERIAL THICKNESS BASED ON MULTIPLE INPUT PARAMETERS
 SUCH AS LOAD, WIDTH, STRENGTH, AND OTHER PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.

 GOAL: 
TO PREDICT THE THICKNESS OF MATERIALS WITH HIGH ACCURACY USING TWO DIFFERENT
 MACHINE LEARNING MODELS: RANDOM FOREST AND LINEAR REGRESSION.
 
 IMPORTANCE: 
THIS KIND OF PREDICTION CAN BE ESSENTIAL IN FIELDS LIKE MATERIALS SCIENCE,
 MANUFACTURING, AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING WHERE PRECISE MATERIAL THICKNESS
 MEASUREMENTS ARE CRITICAL.

DATASET:
 THE DATASET CONTAINS MULTIPLE FEATURES (INPUT PARAMETERS) AND A TARGET
 VARIABLE (MATERIAL THICKNESS). THERE ARE 3000 DATAS IN OUR DATASET

 KEY FEATURES:
 LOAD (N), WIDTH (M), STRENGTH (PA), SAFETY FACTOR, CORROSION ALLOWANCE
 (M), THERMAL EXPANSION, TEMPERATURE CHANGE (°C).
 
 TARGET VARIABLE: THICKNESS (M) – THE VARIABLE WE AIM TO PREDICT BASED ON
 THE FEATURES
 Model Evaluation
 
 Evaluation Metrics:
 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 
Measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual
 values. The lower the RMSE, the better the model.
 
 MAE (Mean Absolute Error):
 Measures the average absolute errors, giving us an idea of the average
 prediction error in the same units as the target variable.
 
 R² (R-squared): 
Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data. A higher R²
 means the model is better at explaining the variability in the target variable.
VISUALIZING THE MODEL PERFORMANCE
 
 PREDICTED VS ACTUAL GRAPHS:
 RANDOM FOREST VS ACTUAL: 
A SCATTER PLOT THAT SHOWS HOW WELL THE RANDOM FOREST MODEL'S
 PREDICTIONS MATCH THE ACTUAL VALUES.
 
 LINEAR REGRESSION VS ACTUAL: 
A SCATTER PLOT FOR THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL, SHOWING ITS PREDICTIONS
 COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL VALUES.
 THE RED DIAGONAL LINE IN EACH GRAPH REPRESENTS PERFECT PREDICTIONS,
 WHERE PREDICTED VALUES MATCH ACTUAL VALUES.
 THE CLOSER THE DATA POINTS ARE TO THIS LINE, THE BETTER THE MODEL.
EVALUATING THE RESULTS
 COMPARISON OF RANDOM FOREST AND LINEAR REGRESSION:
 
 RANDOM FOREST:
 TYPICALLY PERFORMS BETTER ON COMPLEX DATASETS DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO
 MODEL NON-LINEAR RELATIONSHIPS.
 OFTEN RESULTS IN LOWER RMSE AND HIGHER R², ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DATA HAS
 COMPLEX PATTERNS.
 
 LINEAR REGRESSION:
 PERFORMS WELL WHEN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEATURES AND TARGET IS
 LINEAR.
 CAN BE SIMPLER TO INTERPRET BUT MAY NOT PERFORM AS WELL ON NON-LINEAR
 DATA.

 METRICS SUMMARY:
 AFTER EVALUATING BOTH MODELS, WE COMPARE THE RMSE, MAE, AND R² VALUES
 TO SEE WHICH MODEL PERFORMS BETTER.
 BASED ON THESE METRICS, YOU CAN CHOOSE THE MOST ACCURATE MODEL FOR
 YOUR SPECIFIC PROBLEM.
Prediction for New Data
 
 User Input:
 The user is prompted to input values for the material properties (e.g., load, width, strength,
 etc.).
 The input values are then used to predict the material thickness using both trained models
 (Random Forest and Linear Regression).

 Predicted Thickness:
 The predicted material thickness is displayed for both models.
 This demonstrates how the models can be used to make predictions for new, unseen data
